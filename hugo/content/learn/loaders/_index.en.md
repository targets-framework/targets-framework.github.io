You can pass a glob or array of globs to `Targets.load` function if you'd like to have dynamically source targets within your project. Using the `Targets.load` function will also automatically apply any of targets built-in loaders. Additionally, you can pass a second argument to this function with a map of custom loaders to use.

**TODO: what is a loader, how do you create a custom loader, etc.**
